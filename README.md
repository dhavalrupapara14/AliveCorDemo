# AliveCorDemo

###### Coding assignment for AliveCor:
```
Implement an Android application to follow MVVM pattern that has one Activity and two Fragments.

On the first Fragment show the User Profile information as First Name, Last Name and DOB date of birth (as dropdown list to select date month and year) and next button to navigate to the second fragment.

On the second fragment calculate the age of the user and present it on TextView in the middle of the screen with the user's First and Last names and back button to navigate back.

Output format should be as
First name: “AAA”
Last name: “BBB”
Age: XX years , MM month, DD days
```

#### The app has been implemented based on above requirements (exactly followed the requirements) using MVVM, databinding and material UI components. It supports both portrait and landscape orientations.

###### What can be replaced/changed?
- Material Date picker can be used to pick DOB date, month and year for better user experience.
- Multiple text views can be used to display the details on the ViewProfileFragment to avoid alignment issues if values goes beyond 1 line.

#### Sample screenshots, video and APK are in the [screenshots](https://github.com/dhavalrupapara14/AliveCorDemo/tree/main/screenshots) folder.
